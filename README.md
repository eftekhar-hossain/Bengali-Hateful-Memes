# ðŸŒ´Align before Attend (EACL'24)

Multimodal hateful content detection is a challenging task that requires complex reasoning across visual and textual modalities. Therefore, creating a meaningful multimodal representation that effectively captures the interplay between visual and textual features through intermediate fusion is critical. Conventional fusion techniques are unable to attend to the modality-specific features effectively. Moreover, most studies exclusively concentrated on English and overlooked other low-resource languages. We propose a **context-aware attention** framework for multimodal hateful content detection and assesses it for both English and non-English languages. The proposed approach incorporates an **attention layer** to meaningfully align the visual and textual features. This alignment enables selective focus on modality-specific features before fusing them. The proposed achives superior performance approach on two benchmark hateful meme datasets, viz. **MUTE (Bengali code-mixed)** and **MultiOFF (English)**.
